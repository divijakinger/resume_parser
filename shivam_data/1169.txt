ACADEMIC PROJECT:

Project Title: TOWER CRANE

Description:  A crane is   a   type   of machine,   generally   equipped   with   a hoist   rope, wire
ropes or chains, and sheaves, that can be used both to lift and lower materials and to move
them horizontally. It is mainly used for lifting heavy things and transporting them to other
places. The device uses one or more simple machines to create mechanical advantage and
thus move loads beyond the normal capability of a human. Cranes are commonly employed
in
in  
the construction industry for the movement of materials, and in the manufacturing industry
for the assembling of heavy equipment.

Project Title: FLY WHEEL

             Description:  A flywheel is a mechanical device specifically designed to efficiently
store rotational   energy.   Flywheels   resist   changes   in   rotational   speed   by   their moment   of
inertia.   The   amount   of   energy   stored   in   a   flywheel   is   proportional   to   the   square   of
its rotational   speed.   The   way   to   change   a   flywheel   stored   energy   is   by   increasing   or
decreasing its rotational speed applying a torque aligned with its axis of symmetry.
