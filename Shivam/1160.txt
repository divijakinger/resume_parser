Thermal and Structural Analysis of Friction Welded Dissimilar Material

In this work, the relation between the response Tensile Strength and the input parameters were 
studied for the weld between Medium Carbon Steel and Stainless Steel. It was observed that the
maximum strength value was obtained during optimum input parameter setting, In this relation 
there are different Mechanical Testings are carried out such as Tensile Test, Impact and Izod 
Test, Hardness Test, Bending Test, Microstructure Analysis which results give Higher Integrity
of Welded joints and the breakdown of metals carried on outside portion of the Welded Zone
